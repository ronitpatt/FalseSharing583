find struct names

once structs are copied, functions will not be copied
have to make a copy function
change the old function calls to new function calls


check for no functions
find all class names
find all functions
parse the function anme to match with class


padd targets file

could do reordering pass based on processor locality
    but its kind of more hte the same and expected results similar to group and transpose
    he wanted to see when to apply transformations

transformations 
    padding, we did struct, no variable padding 
    group and transpose 
    indirection
    locks???
    we could do some struct reordering - which is kinda simple, or splitting -> slightly harder
    
heuristic for when to apply the transformations    
    magnitude of the false sharing
    
    multiple structs of different hotness
        run trials of padding 1, 2 , or all of them and see how runtime/misrate is affected
        run on some cache constrained test case
